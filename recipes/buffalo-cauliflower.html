    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This Buffalo cauliflower is a great substitution for Buffalo wings and can be made gluten-free, vegan, or vegetarian. Make sure to coat your cookie sheet well with oil, or the cauliflower will stick. My husband and kids give this two thumbs up! You can dip the cauliflower in ranch or blue cheese for added flavor, but it doesn't need it.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>olive oil cooking spray</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>¾ cup gluten-free baking flour (such as Premium Gold® Flax and Ancient Grains All-Purpose Flour)</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder, or to taste</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 heads cauliflower, cut into bite-size pieces</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>½ cup hot pepper sauce (such as Frank's RedHot®)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon honey</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Whisk together water, flour, garlic powder, salt, and pepper in a large bowl until batter is smooth and somewhat runny.</li>
        <li>Add cauliflower pieces to batter and mix until evenly coated; spread onto the prepared baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 20 to 25 minutes. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Remove from heat; stir in hot pepper sauce and honey until smooth.</li>
        <li>Brush hot sauce mixture over each cauliflower piece, repeating until all is used.</li>
        <li>Return to the oven and bake until cauliflower is browned, about 10 minutes. Let cool for 10 to 15 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
